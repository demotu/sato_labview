# Labview software used for the studies on speed-accuracy trade-off during standing


These are Labview computer programs (last run in 2005 with Labview version 6.1) that I wrote for data acquisition and real-time feedback display of force platform center of pressure position and visual targets for experiments based on the Fitts' law paradigm.

**Unfortunately, I cannot provide any assistance with these programs; use as is**.

Some of the studies that used this software are:

- Duarte M, Freitas SM (2005) Speed-accuracy trade-off in voluntary postural movements. Motor Control, 9, 180-196. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15995258/). [PDF](https://bmclab.pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/pubs/mc05.pdf).  
- Freitas SMSF (2005) [Coordenação postural em adultos e idosos durante movimentos voluntários na postura ereta](https://bmclab.pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/pubs/freitas05.pdf). PhD thesis (in Portuguese).  
- Danion F, Duarte M, Grosjean M (1999) Fitts’ law in human standing: the effect of scaling. Neuroscience Letters, 277, 131-133. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10624827/). [PDF](https://bmclab.pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/pubs/nl99.pdf).
