Labview software used for the studies on speed-accuracy trade-off during standing


These are Labview computer programs (last run in 2005 with Labview version 6.1) that I wrote for data acquisition and real-time feedback display of force platform center of pressure position and visual targets for experiments based on the Fitt's law paradigm.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide any assistance with these programs; use as is.

Some of the studies that used this software are:

- Duarte M, Freitas SM (2005) Speed-accuracy trade-off in voluntary postural movements. Motor Control, 9, 180-196. [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15995258&query_hl=2). [PDF](http://pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/bmclab/pubs/mc05.pdf).  
- Freitas SMSF (2005) [Coordenação postural em adultos e idosos durante movimentos voluntários na postura ereta](http://pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/bmclab/pubs/freitas05.pdf). PhD thesis (in Portuguese).
